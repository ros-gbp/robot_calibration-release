* Contributors: Michael Ferguson

0.7.0 (2022-04-20)
------------------
* filter planes by closeness to desired normal (`#124 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/124>`_)
* add finder for laser scan data (`#123 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/123>`_)
  best way to use this right now is to create point laser scanner at a
  wall, create a plane from the laser scan, and align it with a plane
  that has been seen by a camera
* sample observation more evenly (`#122 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/122>`_)
  the plane finder previously took points that were equally distributed by
  point cloud index - however this doesn't actually always represent a
  point cloud that is geometry well distributed. change the sampling so
  that we make one or more passes through the cloud sampling points that
  are at least a minimum distance away from the already sampled points
* refactor plane finder (`#121 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/121>`_)
  * use new eigen_geometry.h functions
  * use ransac to find the best plane
* refactor and improve plane_to_plane cost function (`#120 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/120>`_)
  * use Eigen rather than OpenCV
  * break plane parameter functions into separate header for reuse
  * make final residual distance between planes
  * make plane parameters always in same direction
* make it easier to exit out of calibration (`#119 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/119>`_)
* parameterize max_num_iterations (`#118 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/118>`_)
* add chain3dToMesh calibration (`#116 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/116>`_)
  * add cost function
  * add mesh loader utilities
  * add node to visualize meshes load
* allow using the same camera model with different finders (`#112 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/112>`_)
  the use case here is that a single camera is used in multiple
  finders. When that happens we want the same parameters to
  be used when calibrating the camera intrinsics, but we
  need a different camera name to differentiate which
  observation should be associated with which error block
  (this is especially true for the upcoming robot/plane
  finder)
* add robot finder (`#111 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/111>`_)
  The robot finder can be used to find the base of the robot and the floor at the same time

  * move publishers earlier and make latching
  * don't crash if no points in observation after projecting
* refactor and improve plane finder (`#109 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/109>`_)
  * break up the find() function so that it is more re-usable
  * change points_max parameter to an integer rather than double
  * actually find the plane rather than just assuming everything is part of the plane
* bump cmake version to silence warnings on noetic (`#107 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/107>`_)
* Updated the press key message (`#106 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/106>`_)
