ros-noetic-robot-calibration (0.7.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * filter planes by closeness to desired normal (#124 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/124>)
  * add finder for laser scan data (#123 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/123>)
    best way to use this right now is to create point laser scanner at a
    wall, create a plane from the laser scan, and align it with a plane
    that has been seen by a camera
  * sample observation more evenly (#122 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/122>)
    the plane finder previously took points that were equally distributed by
    point cloud index - however this doesn't actually always represent a
    point cloud that is geometry well distributed. change the sampling so
    that we make one or more passes through the cloud sampling points that
    are at least a minimum distance away from the already sampled points
  * refactor plane finder (#121 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/121>)
    * use new eigen_geometry.h functions
    * use ransac to find the best plane
  * refactor and improve plane_to_plane cost function (#120 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/120>)
    * use Eigen rather than OpenCV
    * break plane parameter functions into separate header for reuse
    * make final residual distance between planes
    * make plane parameters always in same direction
  * make it easier to exit out of calibration (#119 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/119>)
  * parameterize max_num_iterations (#118 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/118>)
  * add chain3dToMesh calibration (#116 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/116>)
    * add cost function
    * add mesh loader utilities
    * add node to visualize meshes load
  * allow using the same camera model with different finders (#112 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/112>)
    the use case here is that a single camera is used in multiple
    finders. When that happens we want the same parameters to
    be used when calibrating the camera intrinsics, but we
    need a different camera name to differentiate which
    observation should be associated with which error block
    (this is especially true for the upcoming robot/plane
    finder)
  * add robot finder (#111 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/111>)
    The robot finder can be used to find the base of the robot and the floor at the same time
  * increase marker size (#117 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/117>)
  * minor improvements and fixes for viz node (#110 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/110>)
    * move publishers earlier and make latching
    * don't crash if no points in observation after projecting
  * refactor and improve plane finder (#109 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/109>)
    * break up the find() function so that it is more re-usable
    * change points_max parameter to an integer rather than double
    * actually find the plane rather than just assuming everything is part of the plane
  * bump cmake version to silence warnings on noetic (#107 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/107>)
  * Updated the press key message (#106 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/106>)
  * Add exception when the chain cannot be created (#105 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/105>)
