  This has apparently NEVER worked. The name that was being
  provided was the error block name, not the name of the
  parameter to limit.
* add to_rpy tool
  The YAML file output by calibration represents angles in
  the internal axis-magnitude notation. RPY tends to be
  easier for people to understand and visualize.
